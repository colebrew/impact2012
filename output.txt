Course Description 
An introduction to computation theory: finite automata, regular languages, Turing machines, 
recursive languages and functions, and computational complexity 
 
Required Textbook 
Introduction to the Theory of Computation, 2nd ed., M. Sipser, Thomson. 
 
Web Site

You must be registered to access this web site. This web site will be used to make 
announcements, distribute homework assignment and solutions, sample exams, etc., so check it 
regularly. 
 
Course Policies 

 
Class Sections 
You must be registered for the lecture section and the discussion section for this course. The 
instructors (professor and GSI) for your lecture and discussion sections are responsible for 
grading and advising you.  
 
Homework Policies 
The lectures and discussion sections will be much more useful to students who have thought 
about the material in advance.  The course schedule below indicates the sections of the textbook 
that will be discussed in class. Be sure that you have read the indicated text sections before each 
class meeting. Homework is not only a way of showing us that you are keeping up with the class 
on a regular basis —it is an important part of the learning process.  
 
Homework will be assigned on Wednesdays and will be posted on the web. Completed 
homework is due on the following Wednesday at the beginning of class.  Late homework will 
not be accepted for any reason, because solutions will be posted on the Web the following 
day. 
 
There will be a total of nine homework assignments. Only the eight highest grades received will 
be used to compute your final course grade. In other words, the lowest grade received by each 
student (including a zero for at most one missed assignment) will be discarded. By throwing out 
the lowest score, we allow you to miss a homework assignment for reasons of illness, a death in 
the family, or any other reason.  You should not squander this resource; if you miss an 
assignment early in the term because you do not feel like turning in the assignment, you may 
regret it later. 
 
Doing the Homework 
Please write your answers clearly and neatly to avoid problems when the grader is correcting 
your homework. Also answer the questions in the order they are assigned; that will help to 
prevent problems, such as questions left ungraded. Show all your work, and state any special 
assumptions you make. 
 

 

2 

You may consult with other students in the class when doing homework. However, the version 
you turn in must be in your own words, written (or typed) in your own hand. 
 
To ease handling of homework, staple all your homework sheets. On the front page, top right 
corner provide the following items: 

 

 
 
 

Name: John P. Doe 
Homework 4. 
 

• Print your name  
• Print the homework number. 
• The result should then look like this: 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Submitting Homework 
Homework will be collected in class by the GSI. 
 
Regrading Homework 
If there is a mistake in the grading of your homework, you have one week to request a regrade 
after the homework is returned to you.  When requesting a regrade, attach a cover page to your 
homework explaining clearly which questions need to be regraded and why.  Note that  “I think I 
deserve more points for this question” is not a valid reason for a regrade.  Homework regrades 
should be submitted to the GSI.  
 
Project Policies 
There will be one project that involves using the development tool Lex.  This will be treated as a 
programming project and must be done on your own.  You are not allowed to work with other 
students in the course.  If you are having difficulties with the project, you may consult the 
professor or GSI, but no one else. 
 
 The Engineering Honor Code applies to the project. Suspected cases of cheating or other 
Honor Code violations will be reported to the Engineering Honor Council and will be dealt with 
severely. If you are unclear about these rules, contact the professor or GSI for clarification. Keep 
this in mind: If you are having trouble finishing an assignment, it is  far better to do your own 
work and receive a low score than to go through  an academic judiciary case and suffer the 
penalties, which may be severe. 
 
What is cheating on a project?  

  having someone else write your program, in whole or in part. 
  copying a program someone else wrote, in whole or in part. 
  collaborating with someone else to the extent that the programs are identifiably similar, in 

whole or in part 

  utilizing program solutions from a previous semester (whether written by a student or the 

course instructor) 

 What is not cheating?  

talking to someone in general about topics and concepts involved. 

 
  asking someone for help with a specific bug or error message in your program. 
  getting help with the specifics of Lex syntax. 

 

3 

  utilizing information given to you by the teaching staff of the course, for example 

copying a paragraph describing the program from the assignment write-up we provide to 
you, copying parts of code from handouts used this course 

 
 
 
Exam Policies 

 

 

 

The Engineering Honor Code applies to the exam. 
There will be three in-class exams.  All exams will be closed book.  On each exam, you will be 
allowed to bring one 4” by 6” file card (or paper cut to these dimensions) with anything you like 
written on it (you can use both sides), but no other material.   Do not  bring a blue book. If you 
cannot take an exam at the scheduled time, notify your instructor at least one week in advance so 
that alternative arrangements can be made. 
 
The exams will be on the following days.  

 

 
 
 
 

 

 

 
 
 

 

 

Exam 1: Wed., Oct. 3 
Exam 2: Wed., Nov. 7 
Exam 3: Fri., Dec. 14, 1:30- 3:30 p.m. 

 

If there is a mistake in the grading of your midterm, you have one week to request a regrade after 
the exam is returned in class (not necessarily a week after you pick up your exam).
